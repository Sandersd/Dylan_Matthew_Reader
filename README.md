# Dylan_Matthew_Reader
Android app for my Wordpress Blog. Scroll through and view recent posts

A blog reader app that uses AsyncTask, SimpleAdapter, JSON, Intent, HashMap, and WebView to display a list of the most recent posts on my personal blog (dylanmatthew.wordpress.com). You can then click on a post and the app loads the URL in a WebView on a different screen.

I post about my personal Android and Java projects and everything related to Computer Science.
